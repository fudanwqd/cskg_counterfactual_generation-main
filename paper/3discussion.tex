\section{Discussion}
Unfortunately due to lack of clairvoyance and omniscience the TAs will not be able to decipher from just your tables and figures what you are trying to suggest, why you did a particular experiment, whether your 
findings are good or bad and if so why. Therefore you are supposed to: 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item provide explanation of the results
 \item guide the TAs and instructors by explaining your results here
 \item explain why a plot or figure supports your hypothesis or not
 \item which technique is better based on which figures and tables
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Please refer to your figures and tables when discussing them.}
\section{Conclusion}
What is the take home message from this experiment you performed? That is, which techniques do you think work better and why. If you had more time which are some things you would have liked to investigate? Did the 
findings from the experiments you performed support your initial hypothesis? If not, what did you learn from this analysis about the data and about the question whose answer you tried to find with this experiment.
